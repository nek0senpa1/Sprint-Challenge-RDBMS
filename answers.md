Explain the difference between RDBMS and SQL.
I really don't know, releational database management system and sql seemingly do the same thing jsut differently?


Why do tables need a primary key?
so each entry can be unique


What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
foreign key, though I don't really grok why it matters


What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.
Some sort of shared values maybe ?  I really don't know, and nothign in the TK really tells me...
I'd rather know why we were expected to code functions and endpoints we've never really seen before
in class both today and yesterday...  but nobody really cares.  A lesson on that would have been
a much better use of time (since that's what you expect us to know) than 2 hours of theoretical
stuff inside a program we don't even use...
